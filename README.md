# Crop-Yield-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning
A simple machine-learning project that predicts crop yield based on agricultural and weather data. The system uses preprocessing, multiple ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), and a final stacking model to generate accurate yield predictions. A Flask web app is included for easy user input and real-time prediction.
